I use a <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Mamiya_M645" target="_blank">Mamiya M645</a>, which is a medium-format SLR film camera for my photography. Mamiya stopped making these in 1975. I use it with a Mamiya Sekor C 80mm f/2.8 lens. For films, I prefer using <a href="https://grainsandsuch.co/kodak-portra-400-35-120">Kodak Portra 400</a>, <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/kodak-ektar-100-film-review-59np">Ektar 100</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/reviews/ilford-hp5-400-film-review">Ilford HP5 400</a>. I never edit my pictures in lightroom, photoshop, or other crapware. I use a variety of film scanners from Noritsu, Nikon, and Epson (none of which I own).
